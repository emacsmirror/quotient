* Quotient

Quotient is a small package that generates random quotes from a corpus file and sets them on the top of the scratch buffer, as the eshell banner or just displays them in the minibuffer.

** Installation

Installation from MELPA (TODO!). An example using the =use-package= method:

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package quotient
  :ensure t
  :bind (("C-c Ã¤" . quotient-set-scratch-message)) ;; Manually reset the scratch message
  :init
  (quotient-set-scratch-message)
  (add-hook 'eshell-mode-hook 'quotient-reset-eshell-message)
  :custom
  (quotient-corpus "etc/corpus.txt") ;; This needs to be under your Emacs directory.
  (quotient-quote-length 4)) ;; The default)
#+end_src

** Usage

Quotient exposes two interactive functions:

| Function                           | Description                                            |
|------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------|
| =quotient-display-random-quote=      | Display a quote in the minibuffer.                     |
| =quotient-set-scratch-message=       | Generate a new quote and set it to the *scratch* buffer. |

There is also =quotient-generate-quote= which generates and returns a quote, in case you want to do this programmatically.

Example uses:

#+begin_src elisp
(quotient-generate-quote 'eshell)
=>
"I something fear my father's wrath, but nothing-
Always reserv'd my holy duty- what
His rage can do on me. You must be gone;
And I shall here abide the hourly shot

"
#+end_src

#+begin_src elisp
(quotient-generate-quote 'comment)
=>
";; We fought the world
;; Kings of metal to be
;; Louder than hell
;; Warriors of the world"
#+end_src

#+begin_src elisp
(quotient-generate-quote)
=>
"I'm here to be paid for the pact that was made
My payment can never be late
Crack the Earth, Gods of Thunder
Man and beast will be torn asunder"
#+end_src
